            <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
            <p class="main-text">So let's say you wanted to make a website. Like this one. What program would you learn? You'd have to learn
            these programming languages called HTML and CSS. And maybe some Javascript, but you don't <i>need</i> it to make a functional website
            <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(This website only uses HTML and CSS). Javascript is nice, though, since it's really
            useful.</span> (update: yay I learned Javascript! Check out some of the games on this site!) But yeah. Apparently they didn't just
            put it all in one language. You gotta learn two. Don't ask me why. I didn't invent this. It's not like working with two is any
            problem, though.</p>

            <p class="main-text" style="font-size: 10px; font-style: italic;">Personally, I think it's a bit weird to talk about the program that
            you're using to make your website; it's like painting a picture of a paintbrush and a canvas. But oh well. It's required for a school
            project anyways.</p>

            <div class="jump-to">

            <h3 id="section1html">HTML</h3>
            <div class="default-img img-border">
                <img src="http://www.tecwallet.com/assets/img/html.jpg" width="18%" alt="html" class="floatleft">
            </div>
            <p class="main-text">HTML is like a skeleton. It forms the basic structure of the webpage and tells the computer where content goes,
            like which paragraph goes where and and in what order to put them. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it was invented in
            1980 by a physicist named Tim Berners-Lee. HTML is used by all websites, including this one. It supports the embedding of text,
            images, and other content commonly found on websites. The most recent version of HTML (as of writing) is HTML5, a revision of
            previous versions. It was released in October of 2014. Usually, the web browser doesn't display the actual HTML document, but rather,
            it displays the content that the document tells it to show.</p>
    
            <p class="main-text">The language of HTML consists of text and/or information surrounded by HTML tags (or just "tags", for short),
            which look like letters or words enclosed between angled brackets. The picture to the upper left shows an example of a tag, the <span
            class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#60;html&#62;</span> tag. This tag tells the web browser, "The HTML document begins here." <span
            class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#60;/html&#62;</span> is what the corresponding closing tag would look like. Notice how the only
            difference between the opening and closing tags is the forward slash that precedes the tag. A paragraph would look something like
            this: <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#60;p&#62;[insert words here]&#60;/p&#62;</span>.</p>

            <p class="main-text">Here's a list of some common HTML tags.</p>

            <p class="main-text">If you want, press <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">Ctrl</span> (<span

            new tab. If you do, you'll notice that most of the words you actually see on this page fall between <span
            class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#60;p&#62;</span> tags, which are for paragraphs. (Perhaps you might have figured out the other tags
            used to create tables?) You might also notice that a lot of the tags don't just "stand by themselves", so to speak. That is, you
            don't just see <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#60;p&#62;</span>, for example, by itself. They often have a bunch of words and
            data between the tag name ("<span class="mono offwhite-highlight">p</span>" in this case) and the closing angle bracket. These are
            called "HTML attributes". Attributes tell the web browser different information about the tag and have various purposes.</p>

            <h3 id="section2css">CSS</h3>
            <p class="main-text">HTML is nice for making webpages, but the webpages it can create by itself don't look too good. CSS is what
            allows webpages to look nice. <span id="css-example">With CSS, I can change fonts, use italics, place underlines, and create
            highlights with rounded corners and dark blue borders like this! (which is kind a ugly, but it shows what CSS can do)</span>
            <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">Did you notice how I styled the HTML tags like this earlier?</span> That was CSS. Did you see
            the way the links in the navbar highlight when you hover your cursor over them? That's also CSS. CSS is amazing. It even allows me to
            do this:</p>
            <div class="black-bg">
                <p class="rainbow">RAINBOW TEXT WOOOOOOOOOOOOOT! YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSS! SOOOOOOO MANY COLOURS!
                ISN'T IT PRETTY?</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p class="main-text">There's a whole lot you can do with CSS. Some stuff is really simple, like changing the font or the size of
            text. Some is more complicated, like the rainbow text. Click <a href="htmlcssugly.html" target="_blank">here</a> to see this webpage
            without CSS styling. You'd be surprised how much different it looks. Click <a href="style.css" target="_blank">here</a> to see the
            CSS stylesheet for this entire website. (Both links open in new tabs.)</p>

            <div class="default-img img-border">
                <img src="https://businessnerds.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/main.gif" width="20%" alt="CSS" class="floatright">
            </div>
            <p class="main-text">Especially if you looked at this page without CSS, you probably have a good grasp on how important it is. So now
            let's get into what CSS actually is. CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets". It's used by most websites, and it makes everything
            look pretty (or terrible if the person doesn't know how to use CSS effectively). CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in October
            of 1994. He worked with Tim Berners-Lee, and at the time, several other styling languages were being proposed.</p>

            <p class="main-text">The language of CSS consists of a <i>selector</i> followed by opening and closing curly brackets. Within those
            brackets are the <i>properties</i> for each selector. Selectors are often html tags, ids, or classes. For example, selecting
            <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">p</span> in CSS (you don't need the angled brackets in CSS) would give all the
            <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#60;p&#62;</span> tags whatever stylings you declare for it. Setting classes and ids are
            especially useful in HTML because normally, you only want to style <i>some</i> of the tags, not all of them, and from there, you can
            style your selected content with CSS.</p>

            <p class="main-text">Here's a list of some common CSS properties.</p>
            <table>

            <p class="main-text" style="margin-bottom: 62px;">Keep in mind that the HTML tags, HTML attributes, and CSS properties I listed above are not the only ones in
            existence. There are <i>so</i> many more. <b>SO MANY MOAR!</b> It's practically impossible to memorise all of them, and in reality,
            most people don't. We just remember the ones we use most often, and that depends on the person. So what do you do if you need
            something that you don't remember? You check the documentation. Many people have used HTML and CSS (and other programming languages),
            and as a result, people have created useful documents to made it easier for other people to learn. The one I personally use most
            often is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>, which has a lot of infomation on HTML and CSS by itself. For everything
            else it can't answer, there are plety more documentations out there on the Internet. A big part about learning to code well is
            learning to use documentation effectively.</p>
