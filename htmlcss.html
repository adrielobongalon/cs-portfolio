            <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
            <p class="main-text">So let's say you wanted to make a website. Like this one. What program would you learn? You'd have to learn these
            programming languages called HTML and CSS. And maybe some Javascript, but you don't <i>need</i> it to make a functional website (This
            website only uses HTML and CSS). Javascript is nice, though, since it's really useful. But yeah. Apparently they didn't just put it all
            in one language. You gotta learn two. Don't ask me why. I didn't invent this. It's not like working with two is any problem, though.</p>

            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <div class="left img-border">
                <img src="http://www.tecwallet.com/assets/img/html.jpg" width="30%" alt="html" class="inline-block">
                <p class="main-text inline-block float-r">HTML is like a skeleton. It forms the basic structure of the webpage and tells the computer
                where content goes, like which paragraph goes where and where</p>
            </div>

            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p class="main-text">CSS aoneuthasnoetudantoheudnatoheudntaoeudnteoau <span class="mono">&#60p&#62 moar text</span></p>
            <div class="black-bg">
                <p class="rainbow">RAINBOW TEXT WOOOOOOOOOOOOO! YEAAAAAAAAAAAHHH! YYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSS!</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sidebar">
            <p class="sidebar-text">On this page, I'll be talking about HTML and CSS. Remember that this is for a school project, and I am required
            to have certain content on this site. Personally, I think it's a bit weird to talk about the program that you're using to make your
            website; it's like painting a picture of a paintbrush and a canvas. But oh well.</p>
