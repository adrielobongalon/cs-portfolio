            <h2>Genius Project</h2>
            <p class="main-text">I go to school at a place called Summit Shasta. Every 10th grader has a project called the "Genius Project" where we
            work on something that interests us. It's sort of based off this thing at Google where their employees get to spend 20% of their time
            working on whatever project that interests them. I'm not entirely sure if that's true or not, but either way, at our school, we get to
            work on something of our choice. On of our assignments is to create a blog. So here it is.</p>
            <div class="jump-to">
                <p class="small-title">Jump to Section</p>

                <div class="img-with-caption">

            </div>
            <p class="main-text">So something I like, huh? Well, to be honest, I had a lot of time to think about what I want to do for this project.
            Although this project actually started in the <i>middle</i> of the school year, I knew about it pretty early on, since several people
            (mostly 11th graders I know) told me about it near the start. And I've had a few ideas.</p>
            
            <div style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; padding: 0;">
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>scarf</li>
                    <li>learn Japanese</li>
                    <li>learn Tagalog</li>
                    <li>code something</li>
                    <li>song mashup</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p class="main-text">Perhaps I should explain a little further. So it's winter, and I've been thinking that I'd like to have a scarf. But
            I'm a rather picky person when it comes to fashion, and I don't like what I see in stores or online. So I thought I'd make it myself. So
            why don't I learn to knit one? Oh yeah. I'm too lazy to. But that won't stop me. Instead, I'll create a loom out of wood and 3D-printed
            material. Still, I don't think I should do this for my Genius Project, since it's basically just following someone else's intructions
            (I found the 3D models of the parts online, made by someone else, so it's not exactly <i>my</i> project).</p>

            tab. If you do, you'll notice that most of the words you actually see on this page fall between <span
            class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#60p&#62</span> tags, which are for paragraphs. (Perhaps you might have figured out the other tags used
            to create tables?) You might also notice that a lot of the tags don't just "stand by themselves", so to speak. That is, you don't just
            see <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#60p&#62</span>, for example, by itself. They often have a bunch of words and data between the
            tag name ("<span class="mono offwhite-highlight">p</span>" in this case) and the closing angle bracket. These are called "HTML
            attributes". Attributes tell the web browser different information about the tag and have various purposes.</p>

            <h3 id="entry2">CSS</h3>
            <p class="main-text">There's a whole lot you can do with CSS. Some stuff is really simple, like changing the font or the size of text.
            Some is more complicated, like the rainbow text. Click <a href="htmlcssugly.html" target="_blank">here</a> to see this webpage without
            CSS styling. You'd be surprised how much different it looks. Click <a href="style.css" target="_blank">here</a> to see the CSS stylesheet
            for this entire website. (Both links open in new tabs.)</p>
            
            <div class="img-border">
                <img src="http://brainkandyinc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/css.jpg" width="20%" alt="CSS" class="floatright">
            </div>
            <p class="main-text">Especially if you looked at this page without CSS, you probably have a good grasp on how important it is. So now
            let's get into what CSS actually is. CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets". It's used by most websites, and it makes everything look
            pretty (or terrible if the person doesn't know how to use CSS effectively). CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in October of 1994.
            He worked with Tim Berners-Lee, and at the time, several other styling languages were being proposed.</p>
            
            <p class="main-text">The language of CSS consists of a <i>selector</i> followed by opening and closing curly brackets. Within those
            brackets are the <i>properties</i> for each selector. Selectors are often html tags, ids, or classes. For example, selecting
            <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">p</span> in CSS (you don't need the angled brackets in CSS) would give all the
            <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#60p&#62</span> tags whatever stylings you declare for it. Setting classes and ids are especially
            useful in HTML because normally, you only want to style <i>some</i> of the tags, not all of them, and from there, you can style your
            selected content with CSS.</p>

            <p class="main-text">Keep in mind that the HTML tags, HTML attributes, and CSS properties I listed above are not the only ones in
            existence. There are <i>so</i> many more. <b>SO MANY MOAR!</b> It's practically impossible to memorise all of them, and in reality,
            most people don't. We just remember the ones we use most often, and that depends on the person. So what do you do if you need something
            that you don't remember? You check the documentation. Many people have used HTML and CSS (and other programming languages), and as a
            result, people have created useful documents to made it easier for other people to learn. The one I personally use most often is
            <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>, which has a lot of infomation on HTML and CSS by itself. For everything else it can't
            answer, there are plety more documentations out there on the Internet. A big part about learning to code well is learning to use
            documentation effectively.</p>
