            <h2>Genius Project</h2>
            <p class="main-text">I go to school at a place called Summit Shasta. Every 10th grader has a project called the "Genius Project" where we
            work on something that interests us. It's sort of based off this thing at Google where their employees get to spend 20% of their time
            working on whatever project that interests them. I'm not entirely sure if that's true or not, but either way, at our school, we get to
            work on something of our choice. On of our assignments is to create a blog. So here it is.</p>
            <div class="jump-to">
                <p class="small-title">Jump to Section</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="#entry1">Blog Entry 1</a></li>

            <h3 id="entry1">Entry 1</h3>
            <div class="caption-box" style="width: 30%; float:left;">
                <div class="img-border">
                    <img src="http://wpshrine.com/uploads/subb/wpshrine_Lucky_Star_192_1920x1200.jpg" width="100%" alt="konota is thinking">
                </div>
                <p class="caption">So I've been thinking&#8230;</p>
            </div>
            <p class="main-text">So something I like, huh? Well, to be honest, I had a lot of time to think about what I want to do for this project.
            Even though this project actually started in the <i>middle</i> of the school year, I knew about it pretty early on, since several people
            (mostly 11th graders I know) told me about it near the start. And I've had a few ideas.</p>

            <div style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; padding: 0;">
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>make a scarf</li>
                    <li>learn Japanese</li>
                    <li>learn Tagalog</li>
                    <li>code something</li>
                    <li>create a song mashup</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p class="main-text">Perhaps I should explain a little further. So it's winter, and I've been thinking that I'd like to have a scarf. But
            I'm a rather picky person when it comes to fashion, and I don't like what I see in stores or online. So I thought I'd make it myself. So
            why don't I learn to knit one? Oh yeah. I'm too lazy to. But that won't stop me. Instead, I'll create a loom out of wood and 3D-printed
            material. Still, I don't think I should do this for my Genius Project, since it's basically just following someone else's intructions
            (I found the 3D models of the parts online, made by someone else, so it's not exactly <i>my</i> project). But I'm still going to make the
            scarf, since I really want one. It gets cold around here.</p>

            <p class="main-text">I also thought about learning Japanese, since it's the language I feel I understand the most (that is,
            conversationally; I take Spanish at school, and I can read and write somewhat well, but I am not too good at listening to a conversation
            and understanding it). I also thought about learning Tagalog. It's the language my parents speak, but for some reason they never taught
            me. In addition, my friend is doing that for her Genius Project (you can find her blog <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>), so we could
            help each other.</p>

            <p class="main-text">Another idea I had was doing some sort of coding project. Perhaps I could expand this site with more coding
            projects. And as much as I love coding, it kind of feels like cheating my making this my Genius Project, since I already work on it
            anyways.</p>
            
            <p class="main-text">So I thought of something new I could try. Something I would enjoy. And I decided I would try to make a mashup. Here
            are some examples of mashups I've seen before (created by other people, of course; not me).</p>

            </div>
            
            <p class="main-text">My first thought was to learn to make an EDM song, because that's the kind of music I like. Perhaps it would have
            been glitch hop or electro house, but that wouldn't show the "community aspect" of my project. It needs to have an effect on people. And
            making a song mainly affects me. So I thought of ways to involve others. And then it hit me. I would ask other people for song
            suggestions, and use them all in a mashup. That way, other people play a part in my project too. And I think I could make people happy by
            combining their songs together. Although maybe few people might be bothered if their song gets mixed with other songs they don't like.
            But I'm sure that most people will be fine with it.</p>
