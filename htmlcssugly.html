            <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
            <p class="main-text">So let's say you wanted to make a website. Like this one. What program would you learn? You'd have to learn these
            programming languages called HTML and CSS. And maybe some Javascript, but you don't <i>need</i> it to make a functional website (This
            website only uses HTML and CSS). Javascript is nice, though, since it's really useful. But yeah. Apparently they didn't just put it all
            in one language. You gotta learn two. Don't ask me why. I didn't invent this. It's not like working with two is any problem, though.</p>

            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <div class="left img-border">
                <img src="http://www.tecwallet.com/assets/img/html.jpg" width="30%" alt="html" class="inline-block">
                <p class="main-text inline-block float-r">HTML is like a skeleton. It forms the basic structure of the webpage and tells the computer
                where content goes, like which paragraph goes where and and in what order to put them. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and
                it was invented in 1980 by a physicist named Tim Berners-Lee. HTML is used by all websites, including this one. It supports the
                embedding of text, images, and other content commonly found on websites. The most recent version of HTML (as of writing) is HTML5, a
                revision of previous versions. It was released in October of 2014. Usually, the web browser doesn't display the actual HTML document,
                but rather, it displays the content that the document tells it to show.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="main-text">The language of HTML consists of text and/or information surrounded by HTML tags (or just "tags", for short), which
            look like letters or words enclosed between angled brackets. The picture to the upper left shows an example of a tag, the <span
            class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#60html&#62</span> tag. This tag tells the web browser, "The HTML document begins here." <span
            class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#60/html&#62</span> is what the corresponding closing tag would look like. Notice how the only
            difference between the opening and closing tags is the forward slash that precedes the tag.</p>
            
            <p class="main-text">Here's a list of some common HTML tags.</p>
            <table>

                        <td>division & span</td>
                        <td>used to group content, div and span have slightly different uses that </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p class="main-text">If you want, press <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">Ctrl</span> (<span
            class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#8984</span> on a Mac) + <span
            class="mono">U</span> to open up the HTML document for this page in a new tab. If you do, you'll notice that most of the words you
            actually see on this page fall between <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#60p&#62</span> tags, which stands for "paragraph".</p>

            <p class="sidebar-text">On this page, I'll be talking about HTML and CSS. Remember that this is for a school project, and I am required
            to have certain content on this site. Personally, I think it's a bit weird to talk about the program that you're using to make your
            website; it's like painting a picture of a paintbrush and a canvas. But oh well.</p>
