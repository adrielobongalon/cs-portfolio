                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <div class="img-border">
                    <img src="me1edit.jpg" style="width: 20%; margin:15px 15px 0px 20px;" alt="picture of me" class="floatleft">
                </div>
                <p class="main-text">Hello there. I suppose I should tell you a little bit about myself. My name is Adrielo Bongalon, although you
                probably already know that, since my name is, like, all over this website. (I'm not a narcissist. I promise.) But yeah, I know. It
                <i>is</i> a weird name. My friends call me "Audrey" because it's much shorter, and it sounds nicer. You can call me whichever. But, don't
                use "whichever" as my name. You know what I mean. I think.</p>

                <p class="main-text">But enough about my name already. As of writing this, I'm a 15-year-old 10th grader. That picture to the left?
                That's me. Not exactly the <i>best</i> picture of me, but hey, that's what I look like. I'm at my school in the picture, Summit Shasta, a
                high school in a city near San Francisco. It's sort of a weird school. Last year, we were in an office building, and there weren't walls
                between classrooms. We didn't have walls. AND MY MATH TEACHER WAS OBSESSED WITH PARABOLAS. And another teacher I liked stole my friend's
                coffee cup. Okay, so the part about the teachers was actually just these really bad jokes I have with my best friend Jelly, but the part
                about having no walls is true. And now we've moved to a new place. The way my 9th grade English teacher described it, "We've transformed
                this place that used to be tundra and dirt into... still turdra and dirt but with learning." That day was also the day all the teachers
                flash mobbed us. And last year, there was one day when someone made a sculpture out of the chairs and they were just stacked weirdly
                against the wall. And another time, there was a stool hanging from the ceiling. (There are pictures below.) Yeah... Shasta's a weird
                school. But it's really fun, so I don't care.</p>

                <div class="centre img-border">
                    <img src="chair_sculpture.jpg" style="width: 40%; margin-right: 7px;" alt="chair sculpture.">
                    <img src="stool_on_ceiling.jpg" style="width: 40%; margin-left: 7px;" alt="chair hanging from ceiling.">
                    <p class="subtext">That moment when you come in to school and your chairs don't make sense.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="main-text">I was borne in Adelaide, Australia. Yes, I am Australian. But not by blood. After three years of living there, I
                moved to California, and I've lived there ever since. I've traveled to various places in the US, visited Canada once, and I also got to
                visit the Philippines for a while, since I have some relatives there.</p>

                <p class="main-text">Two of my favourite songs are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYot9Shfees" target="_blank">Sweet</a> (by
                I.Y.F.F.E, Au5, and Auratic) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxFQeIniK1w" target="_blank">God Knows</a> (by Aya Hirano). If
                you know last one, you probably know that I like anime, because that song was from <i>Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu</i>. Some of my other
                favourite anime include <i>Angel Beats</i>, <i>GJ-bu</i>, <i>Toradora</i>, <i>Lucky Star</i>, and <i>Seitokai no Ichizon</i>. I might be a weeb, as
                embarassing as it is to admit. Jelly says I am.</p>

                <p class="main-text">I have a lot of hobbies. One of them is playing bass guitar. I play a Gretsch G2202, and I've been playing for about
                six years. I play mostly rock and jazz music. I like playing bass guitar because I get to play music that I like. I started because my
                friends, back when I was in 5th grade, wanted to start a band. We never ended up playing together that much, but the good thing is that I
                learned a new hobby. I've performed a couple of times, and once, I got to play for the Golden Gate Bridge's 75th anniversary worker
                celebration. Which was pretty cool.</p>

                <p class="main-text">I also play electric guitar, but I'm not as good at that as playing the bass. Other hobbies of mine include archery,
                arnis (Filipino stickfighting), watching anime, playing video games, and coding.</p>

                <p class="main-text">Hmm... what else. Oh yeah. I use Photoshop. I grew up using CS4 Extended, and I used it to make the favicon for
                this website. It looks kinda bad when it's sized so small. It's smol like me lol. Anyways, here's a sized-up version of it. Looks
                nicer when it's big, right?</p>

                <p class="sidebar-text">The stuff on this page is for a school assignment, so the content might seem a bit unrelated. If it does, it's
                because the project requires that I answer a set of questions. Normally, I wouldn't say this much about myself.</p>
