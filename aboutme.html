            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="main-text">Hello there. I suppose I should tell you a little bit about myself. My name is Adrielo Bongalon, although you
            probably already know that, since my name is, like, all over this website. (I'm not a narcissist. I promise.) But yeah, I know. It
            <i>is</i> a weird name. My friends call me "Audrey" because it's much shorter, and it sounds nicer. You can call me whichever. But, don't
            use "whichever" as my name. You know what I mean. I think.</p>
            
            <p class="main-text">But enough about my name already. As of writing this, I'm a 15 year old 10th grader at Summit Shasta, a high school
            in a city near San Francisco. It's sort of a weird school. Last year, we were in an office building, and there weren't walls between
            classrooms. We didn't have walls. AND MY MATH TEACHER WAS OBSESSED WITH PARABOLAS. And another teacher I liked stole my friend's coffee
            cup. Okay, so the part about the teachers was actually just these really bad jokes I have with my best friend Jelly, but the part about
            no walls is true. But now we've moved to a new place. The way my 9th grade English teacher described it, "We've transformed this place
            that used to be tundra and dirt into... still turdra and dirt but with learning." That day was also the day all the teachers flash mobbed
            us with that "watch me whip" song (sorry I don't know the actual title). And last year, there was one day when someone made a sculpture
            out of the chairs and they were just stacked weirdly against the wall. And another time, there was a stool hanging from the ceiling.
            (There are pictures below.) Yeah... Shasta's a weird school. But it's really fun, so I don't care.</p>

                <p class="subtext">That moment when you come to school and your chairs don't make sense.</p>

            <p class="main-text">I was borne in Adelaide, Australia. Yes. I am Australian. But not by blood. After three years of living there, I
            moved to California, and I've lived there ever since. I've traveled to various places in the US, visited Canada once, and I also got to
            visit the Philippines for a while, since I have some relatives there.</p>

            <p class="main-text">Two of my favourite songs are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYot9Shfees" target="_blank">Sweet</a> (by
            I.Y.F.F.E, Au5, and Auratic) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxFQeIniK1w" target="_blank">God Knows</a> (by Aya Hirano). If
            you know last one, you probably know that I like anime, because that song was from <i>Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu</i>. Some of my other
            favourite anime include <i>Angel Beats</i>, <i>GJ-bu</i>, <i>Toradora</i>, and <i>Seitokai no Ichizon</i>. I might be a weeb, as
            embarassing as it is to admit. Jelly says I am.</p>
            
            <p class="main-text">I have a lot of hobbies. One of them is playing bass guitar. I play a Gretsch G2202, and I've been playing for about
            six years. I play mostly rock and jazz music. I like playing bass guitar because I get to play music that I like. I started because my
            friends, back when I was in 5th grade, wanted to start a band. We never ended up playing together that much, but the good thing is that I
            learned a new hobby. I've performed a couple of times, and once, I got to play for the Golden Gate Bridge's 75th anniversary worker
            celebration. Which was pretty cool.</p>
            
            <p class="main-text">I also play electric guitar, but I'm not as good at that as playing the bass. Other hobbies of mine include archery,
            arnis (Filipino stickfighting), watching anime, playing video games, and coding.</p>

            <p class="sidebar-text">The stuff on this page is for a school assignment, so the content might seem a bit unrelated. If it does, it's
            because the project requires that I answer a set of questions, so it's because I have to answer questions. Normally, I wouldn't say this
            much about myself.</p>
