            <p class="main-text">Hello there. I suppose I'll tell you a little bit about myself. My name is Adrielo Bongalon, although you
            probably already know that, since my name is, like, all over this website. (I'm not a narcissist. I promise.) But yeah. I know
            what you're probably thinking. It <i>is</i> a weird name. I agree. Plus, it has multiple pronunciations, all of which I will respond
            to. My parents gave the name to me, so it's not like I had a choice. Well actually, it was my aunt, not my parents, that gave it to me,
            which I'm actually grateful for, as much as I hate the name. You know why? Because I was almost named "Lapu-Lapu" by my father. Now
            "Adrielo" doesn't sound so bad, right? I mean, Lapu-Lapu was the guy who killed Magellan (you probably think of him as a great explorer,
            but in my culture, he's the guy who invaded the country), so I guess it's not too bad <i>in concept</i>, but it still sounds
            weird in English, which is the language I've been speaking my whole life.</p>
            
            <p class="main-text">My friends call me "Audrey" because it's much shorter, and it sounds nicer. You can call me whichever. Like,
            don't say, "Hi, whichever." But I mean you can call me "Adrielo" or "Audrey". You know what? "Whichever" is fine, actually. My best
            friend calls me "dingus" and "ugly" (and I respond to it when she says that; we have a weird friendship), so "whichever" is sort of
            better, I guess.</p>
            
            <p class="main-text">But enough about my name already. It's been, like, two whole paragraphs, and all I've really done is ramble on about
            my name. Wow. Okay, so I'll talk about something else. As of writing this, I'm a 15 year old 10th grader at Summit Shasta, a high school
            in a city near San Francisco. It's a weird school, sort of. Last year, we were in an office building, and there weren't walls between
            classrooms. We had these shelves to divide the place, but you could always hear people in the other classes. And my favourite teacher was
            obsessed with parabolas. And another teacher I liked stole my friend's coffee cup and regularly used it as his own. Okay, so the part
            about the teachers was really just this really bad joke I have with my best friend, but the part about no walls is true. Right now, we've
            been moved to this other place sort of near the old office building. The way my 9th grade English teacher described it, "We've
            transformed this place that used to be tundra and dirt into... still turdra and dirt but with learning." That day was also the day all
            the teachers flash mobbed us with that "watch me whip" song (sorry I don't know the actual title). And we really had only one day of PE
            last year. On that day, the teachers were blasting "Eye of the Tiger" and the Rocky Balboa theme to troll us. And last year, there
            usually wasn't enough chairs for everyone, so some of us had no kneel on the floor. And there was one day when someone made a sculpture
            out of the chairs and they were just stacked weirdly against the wall. And another time, there was a stool hanging from the ceiling.
            (There are pictures below.) Yeah... Shasta's a weird school. But it's really fun, so I don't care.</p>
