            <p class="main-text">Hello! My name is Adrielo Bongalon. Welcome to my website. I hope you like it. I made it myself, with some help from
            my computer science teacher Mr. Hesby. This site was meant for a school project, so the content on this site might seem a bit random or
            unrelated (like when I start talking about hardware and HTML). That aside, I tried to make it as good as possible, so please enjoy!</p>
            <p class="main-text">Oh, and I should probably tell you that the "Hardware" and "Animation" pages do not exist on this site yet. They
            haven't been created yet. If you click on them in the navbar, they won't do anything. But everything else works. I'll likely make them
            sometime in the future, so that's why I didn't remove their buttons in the navbar, in case you were wondering.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sidebar">
            <h4>About</h4>
            <p class="sidebar-text">sidebar stuff here</p>
            <p class="sidebar-text">um... okay. so I wanted to put a sidebar on my site, but now that I think about it, I don't really need one... at
            least not on this page. maybe they'll be more useful on the others? so, um, I guess I'll just talk about myself. actually, no. I'll save
            that for my "about me" page. derp =P</p>
