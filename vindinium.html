            <h2>Vindinium</h2>
            <p class="main-text">Vindinium! It totally sounds like a metallic element. But it's actually a game. It's lots of fun, and it's good for
            learning how to code. At my school, I'm taking a computer science course as an elective, and one of our projects is to make our own bot
            for the game. And here, I'm going to talk about it.</p>
            <div class="jump-to">
                <p class="small-title">Jump to Section</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="#vindinium1">The Game</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#vindinium2">My Code</a></li>

                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3 id="vindinium1">The Game</h3>
            <div class="caption-box" style="width: 40%; float:left;">
                <div class="img-with-caption">
                    <img src="vindinium.png" style="width: 100%;"; alt="screenshot of vindinium">
                </div>
                <p class="caption">a screenshot of the game (I'm not playing in this one)</p>
            </div>
            <p class="main-text">So let's go over the rules and stuff. Vindinium is a turn based game. You get one player/character thingy who starts
            out with 100HP. And each turn, you can move one space (or stay in place). Depending on what you walk into, your guy will do different
            things.</p>

            <p class="main-text">The goal is to have the most amount of gold by the end of the game, which, in my experience, usually consists of
            1200 turns. You can get gold by going into the mines. Problem is, they're guarded by goblins, so each time you do, you'll have to fight
            them. But if you survive, then the mine belongs to you, and you get 1 gold per mine you own at the end of each turn. If you step into
            your own mine, nothing happens. But if you step into an unowned mine, or one that belongs to someone else, then you lose 20HP, but gain
            control of the mine.</p>
            
            <p class="main-text">So obviously, you eventually gotta get your health back up, and you can do that by going into the taverns, which I
            call pubs, because, well let's face it. <i>Pubs</i> just sounds better than <i>taverns</i>. Anyways, at the pubs, you pay 2 gold to get
            50HP.</p>

            <p class="main-text">If you try to step out of the map, or into a tree or wall, nothing happens. If your bot takes too long to figure out
            what to do (1 second), then your bot, he stays in place until the end of the game (but can still win if you have the most gold by the
            end). So make sure your bot works, or else it'll stay stuck in I-don't-know-what-to-do-mode.</p>

            <p class="main-text">Here's a list of some common HTML tags.</p>

            <p class="main-text">If you want, press <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">Ctrl</span> (<span
            class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#8984</span> on a Mac) + <span class="mono">U</span> to open up the HTML document for this page in a new
            tab. If you do, you'll notice that most of the words you actually see on this page fall between <span
            class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#60p&#62</span> tags, which are for paragraphs. (Perhaps you might have figured out the other tags used
            to create tables?) You might also notice that a lot of the tags don't just "stand by themselves", so to speak. That is, you don't just
            see <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#60p&#62</span>, for example, by itself. They often have a bunch of words and data between the
            tag name ("<span class="mono offwhite-highlight">p</span>" in this case) and the closing angle bracket. These are called "HTML
            attributes". Attributes tell the web browser different information about the tag and have various purposes.</p>

            <p class="main-text">Here's a list of some common HTML attributes.</p>








            <h3 id="vindinium2">My Code</h3>
            <p class="main-text">There's a whole lot you can do with CSS. Some stuff is really simple, like changing the font or the size of text.
            Some is more complicated, like the rainbow text. Click <a href="htmlcssugly.html" target="_blank">here</a> to see this webpage without
            CSS styling. You'd be surprised how much different it looks. Click <a href="style.css" target="_blank">here</a> to see the CSS stylesheet
            for this entire website. (Both links open in new tabs.)</p>

            <div class="img-border">
                <img src="http://brainkandyinc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/css.jpg" width="20%" alt="CSS" class="floatright">
            </div>
            <p class="main-text">Especially if you looked at this page without CSS, you probably have a good grasp on how important it is. So now
            let's get into what CSS actually is. CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets". It's used by most websites, and it makes everything look
            pretty (or terrible if the person doesn't know how to use CSS effectively). CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in October of 1994.
            He worked with Tim Berners-Lee, and at the time, several other styling languages were being proposed.</p>

            <p class="main-text">The language of CSS consists of a <i>selector</i> followed by opening and closing curly brackets. Within those
            brackets are the <i>properties</i> for each selector. Selectors are often html tags, ids, or classes. For example, selecting
            <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">p</span> in CSS (you don't need the angled brackets in CSS) would give all the
            <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">&#60p&#62</span> tags whatever stylings you declare for it. Setting classes and ids are especially
            useful in HTML because normally, you only want to style <i>some</i> of the tags, not all of them, and from there, you can style your
            selected content with CSS.</p>
