            <p class="main-text">Vindinium! It totally sounds like a metallic element. But it's actually a game. It's lots of fun, and it's good for
            learning how to code. At my school, I'm taking a computer science course as an elective, and one of our projects is to make our own bot
            for the game. And here, I'm going to talk about it.</p>
            <div class="jump-to">
                <p class="small-title">Jump to Section</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="#vindinium1">The Game</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#vindinium2">My Code</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#vindinium3">What I Learned</a></li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3 id="vindinium1">The Game</h3>
            <div class="caption-box" style="width: 40%; float:left;">
                <div class="img-with-caption">
                    <img src="vindinium.png" style="width: 100%;"; alt="screenshot of vindinium">
                </div>
                <p class="caption">a screenshot of the game (I'm not playing in this one)</p>
            </div>
            <p class="main-text">So let's go over the rules and stuff. Vindinium is a turn based game. You get one player/character thingy who starts
            out with 100HP. And each turn, you can move one space (or stay in place). Depending on what you walk into, your guy will do different
            things.</p>

            <p class="main-text">The goal is to have the most amount of gold by the end of the game, which, in my experience, usually consists of
            1200 turns. You can get gold by going into the mines. Problem is, they're guarded by goblins, so each time you do, you'll have to fight
            them. But if you survive, then the mine belongs to you, and you get 1 gold per mine you own at the end of each turn. If you step into
            your own mine, nothing happens. But if you step into an unowned mine, or one that belongs to someone else, then you lose 20HP, but gain
            control of the mine.</p>
            
            <p class="main-text">So obviously, you eventually gotta get your health back up, and you can do that by going into the taverns, which I
            call pubs, because, well let's face it. <i>Pubs</i> just sounds better than <i>taverns</i>. Anyways, at the pubs, you pay 2 gold to get
            50HP.</p>

            <p class="main-text">If you try to step out of the map, or into a tree or wall, nothing happens. If your bot takes too long to figure out
            what to do (1 second), then your bot, he stays in place until the end of the game (but can still win if you have the most gold by the
            end). So make sure your bot works, or else it'll stay stuck in I-don't-know-what-to-do-mode. If you step into another player, you'll
            attack them, and they'll attack you. So you both lose 20HP. If you kill another player, you gain control of all their mines.</p>
