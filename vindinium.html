            <h2>Vindinium</h2>
            <p class="main-text">Vindinium! It totally sounds like a metallic element. But it's actually a game. It's lots of fun, and it's good for
            learning how to code. At my school, I'm taking a computer science course as an elective, and one of our projects is to make our own bot
            for the game. And here, I'm going to talk about it.</p>
            <div class="jump-to">
                <p class="smol-title">Jump to Section</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="#vindinium1">The Game</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#vindinium2">My Code</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#vindinium3">What I Learned</a></li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3 id="vindinium1">The Game</h3>
            <div class="caption-box" style="width: 40%; float:left;">
                <div class="img-border" style="display: inline-block;">
                    <img src="vindinium.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="screenshot of vindinium">
                </div>
                <p class="caption">a screenshot of the game (I'm not playing in this one)</p>
            </div>
            <p class="main-text">So let's go over the rules and stuff. Vindinium is a turn based game. You get one player/character thingy who starts
            out with 100HP. And each turn, you can move one space (or stay in place). Depending on what you walk into, your guy will do different
            things.</p>

            <p class="main-text">The goal is to have the most amount of gold by the end of the game, which, in my experience, usually consists of
            1200 turns. You can get gold by going into the mines. Problem is, they're guarded by goblins, so each time you do, you'll have to fight
            them. But if you survive, then the mine belongs to you, and you get 1 gold per mine you own at the end of each turn. If you step into
            your own mine, nothing happens. But if you step into an unowned mine, or one that belongs to someone else, then you lose 20HP, but gain
            control of the mine.</p>
            
            <p class="main-text">So obviously, you eventually gotta get your health back up, and you can do that by going into the taverns, which I
            call pubs, because, well let's face it. <i>Pubs</i> just sounds better than <i>taverns</i>. Anyways, at the pubs, you pay 2 gold to get
            50HP.</p>

            <p class="main-text">If you try to step out of the map, or into a tree or wall, nothing happens. If your bot takes too long to figure out
            what to do (1 second), then your bot, he stays in place until the end of the game (but can still win if you have the most gold by the
            end). So make sure your bot works, or else it'll stay stuck in I-don't-know-what-to-do-mode. If you step into another player, you'll
            attack them, and they'll attack you. So you both lose 20HP. If you kill another player, you gain control of all their mines.</p>




















            <h3 id="vindinium2">My Code</h3>
            <p class="main-text">I made my bot in JavaScript. If you want to see the file, click <a href="js/vindiniumCode.js" target="_blank">here</a>.
            Below, I will try my best to explain my bot my breaking the code into sections.</p>
            
            <p class="main-text">So instead of going from top to bottom, I think I'll describe my code in roughly the order that I created it.
            Interestingly, that means we'll be starting at the end of the code.</p>

            <p><pre class="hax-txt"><code>if (myDir === "none" || myDir === undefined) {
    if (myDir === undefined) {
        if (task === "none") {
            console.log("no task. random direction");
        }
        else {
            console.log("direction is undefined. check code for errors");
        }
    }
    if (task !== "none") {
        console.log("random direction");
    }
    var rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 4);
    var dirs = ["north", "south", "east", "west"];
    bot.goDir = dirs[rand];
}
else {
    bot.goDir = myDir;
}</code></pre></p>

            <p class="main-text">O_______________________O &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp lol wut?</p>

            <p class="main-text">Don't worry. It's not <i>that</i> complicated. All this is is a fail-safe. Basically, I assign my bot both a
            <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">task</span> (what I want it to do each turn) and a <span class="mono offwhite-highlight">myDir</span>
            (direction to go in). If either I ask it not to go anywhere (<span class="mono offwhite-highlight">myDir === "none"</span>) or if some
            other part of my code doesn't run properly (<span class="mono offwhite-highlight">myDir === undefined</span>), then my bot will choose a
            random direction and go that way. But most of the time, it will run the last three lines, which basically tell my bot to go whatever way
            I tell it to (which gets defined elsewhere in the code). All the mumbo jumbo in the middle just tries to figure out what the problem is
            and sends it to the "console log", which is basically a debugging tool that displays a message that you tell it to send when something in
            your code happens.</p>








            <p class="main-text">By the way, here's what the gets put on the console log every turn of the game (although it sholud be pretty
            self-explanatory just by looking at the pictures):</p>

                <li style="list-style-type: square;">the weaklings, and their id</li>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">basically any bot that's weaker than me</li>
                </ul>
                <li style="list-style-type: square;">the richest enemy, and how many are equally as rich as that enemy</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: square;">the richest weakling (if any)</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: square;">whatever task i assign my bot</li>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">"freemine" - searches for and mines the nearest free mine</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">"pub" - get health</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">"attack" - should be self explanatory</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">"murder" - this is pretty mean. if there's anyone richer than me who also has less health,
                    my bot will specifically target it and try to kill it. my bot is also smart enough not to attack "campers", which i'll explain
                    later</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">"none" - more of a backup thing than something i actually want it to do</li>
                </ul>
                <li style="list-style-type: square;">then there's the information line. it basically gives me more information on what my bot is
                doing. a lot of them contain obscure references</li>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">"mining for free cash money at [<i>mine location</i>]" tells me where my bot is mining if
                    the task is set to "freemine" (reference to this stupid joke my friend made)</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">"charlie mops" is basically code for getting health. (anyone get this reference?)</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">"LEAVE AUDREY ALONE!" means i'm attacking someone. (reference to Keralis's sword)</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">"IM BLEEDING OUT" means i'm dying (reference to pretty much every FPS game)</li>
                </ul>
                <li style="list-style-type: square;">the direction my bot is heading</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="main-text">One thing I'd like to note about the console log is the colours. I snooped around with the other files, and I
            figured out how they coloured some of the stuff in the console log. And from there, I basically taught myself how to change the colours
            for both the text and highlight colours. And it's kind a cool learning through reverse-engineering, rather than normal instruction.
            Still, I couldn't figure out what made the table contents red, so I couldn't change the colours on those. It bothers me because the red
            is hard to read on the blue background. Oh well.</p>








            <p class="main-text" style="margin-top: 90px;">And then there's this thing.</p>
            <p><pre class="hax-txt"><code>if (task === "freemine") {
    console.log("mining for free cash money at [ " + nearestMine + " ]");
    myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, nearestMine);
}
else if (task === "pub") {
    console.log("charlie mops");
    myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, nearestPub);
}
else if (task === "attack") {
    console.log("LEAVE AUDREY ALONE!");
    myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, [nearestFoolishMortal.pos.x, nearestFoolishMortal.pos.y]);
}
else if (task === "murder") {
    myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, [richestWeakling.pos.x, richestWeakling.pos.y]);
}</code></pre></p>
            <p class="main-text">It started with just the first four lines telling it to mine when I tell it to. Then I changed it so that it still
            works when I tell it to go to pubs or attack other players. This tells the bot what direction to go in based on its task.</p>

            <p class="main-text" style="margin-top: 90px;">This section assigns tasks based on what's going on. The attack algorithm looks pretty
            big, relatively, but the comments (stuff after the double slashes) explain them pretty well. Basically, in order to attack an enemy, my
            bot makes sure that it has a lot more health than the enemy (and enough to get to a pub afterwards), not too far away, and that the enemy
            actually owns mines. Because what's the point of attacking a player without mines? The whole purpose of attacking is to take control of
            all of their mines at once.</p>
            <p><pre class="hax-txt"><code>var task;
if (bot.yourBot.life >= 35 && nearestFoolishMortal.life <= bot.yourBot.life + 10 &&                 // needs enough health to outlast the enemy and get back to a pub
bot.findDistance(myPos, [nearestFoolishMortal.pos.x, nearestFoolishMortal.pos.y]) <= 11 &&          // dont bother if they're too far away (moar than 10 spaces)
nearestFoolishMortal.mineCount > 0) {                                                               // why bother attacking if you wont get anything out of it?
    task = "attack";
    console.log("enemy has only " + colors.yellow(nearestFoolishMortal.life + " hp") + " hp left");
}
else if (bot.yourBot.life <= 15) {
    task = "pub";
}
else if (bot.freeMines.length > 0) {
    task = "freemine";
}
else if (bot.yourBot.life >= 35 && richestWeakling != "none" && rwNotCamping) {
    task = "murder";
}
else {
    task = "none";
}
console.log("my task: " + colors.bgCyan(task));</code></pre></p>
            <p class="main-text">Only look for health when you need it, only look for free mines if they exist in the first place, only go on murder
            mode if you have enough health and there's someone with enough money who's not camping, etc etc etc. Oh and if none of that happens, then
            don't do anything. Not much going on here. Although you might notice me calling them "foolish mortals". Why am I like this? I try way too
            hard to be funny.</p>








            <p class="main-text" style="margin-top: 90px;">One of the pieces of code I was given to start was this.</p>
            <p><pre class="hax-txt"><code>var nearestMine = bot.freeMines[0];
for (i = 0; i < bot.freeMines.length; i++) {
    if (bot.findDistance(myPos, nearestMine) > bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.freeMines[i])) {
        nearestMine = bot.freeMines[i];

            <p class="main-text" style="margin-top: 500px;">But surprisingly, even though all that code accounts for the majority of my bot's
            functions, it accounts for <i>less than half</i> of my bot's code. It turns out the majority of my code is spent trying to figure out who is the
            richest enemy, and of those people, which ones I should attack. If you thought the stuff up there was a lot, then what's coming up might
            appear to be overkill. But I think it's worth it, because if you attack the wrong person, you're essentially making yourself bait. No
            point in trying to attack someone and getting killed in the process, right?</p>








            <p class="main-text" style="margin-top: 500px;">Let's start with this.</p>

    }
}
console.log("weaklings: ");
if (weaklings.length > 0) {
    for (i = 0; i < weaklings.length; i++) {
        console.log("potential weak target identified: " + colors.yellow(weaklings[i].id));

            <p class="main-text">This tells the bot which enemies are weaker than it (if any are).</p>








            <p class="main-text" style="margin-top: 90px;">Then I did this.</p>

            <p class="main-text">The comments should probably explain it enough, but basically, it first checks if any enemy is richer than another.
            If not, then my bot just goes for the nearest one. (Because why go across the whole map?) But this became mostly for informational
            purposes. Because I don't necessarily plan to attack the richest enemy, especially if they'll kill me before I kill them. But it does get
            put into the console log, so I know who I need to beat by the end of the game.</p>








            <p class="main-text" style="margin-top: 90px;">Still, I had that problem that I only wanted to deal with the people I <i>could</i> kill, not

            <p class="main-text">Okay. So this is a lot. Put simply, this finds the ideal target. It looks through every bot who is weaker than me,
            then finds the richest one. If multiple people are the richest, it finds the closest. It also does some things that accounts for no one
            being weaker than me and for none of the enemies having any mines (in both cases, the richest weakling becomes "none"). You might notice
            that I call the rich bots "Ouran Kids". Yeah&#8230; I'm kinda a weeb.</p>








            <p class="main-text" style="margin-top: 90px;">At this point, I thought I was done. Like seriously. It's a rather large amount of code
            just to figure out who to attack. But here's the worst part. When I actually tested my bot, it didn't go so well. Why? Because everyone
            else in my class was basically making what I call "camper bots". They all just went to get one mine, and then from there, keep standing
            next to a pub so that they'd never die. This became a problem because my bot would occasionally try to attack them, but they would kill
            me because they have essentially infinite health, while blocking my access to health at the same time. So I created the section below.</p>

            <p class="main-text" style="margin-top: 90px;">It checks if the richest weakling is within 3 spaces of a pub. If it is, my bot regards it
            as "camping" (even if it's just getting health, I decided not to attack them because they'll heal to quickly). For everyone else, I check
            first where the closet pub they can reach is. Then I check if they're closer to it than I am. If I'm closer, I attack them, because it's
            very likely I will be able to intercept them before they can get there. If they're closer, though, then I check to make sure they're far
            enough from the pub. Otherwise, my bot doesn't attack them.</p>








            <p class="main-text" style="margin-top: 90px;">and of course, there's my ASCII signature at the top. It also contains the Vindinium keys
            I use for my bots, just in in case I lose it. It's hard to accidentally delete that giant thing.</p>

            in Vindinium that I was pretty much forced to use them. Even the map itself is an array of arrays. And finding data about my enemies
            often involved me looking at arrays within arrays. But it was definitely worth learning.</p>
            <p class="main-text">I learned about array indices, how to create arrays, and how to add items into arrays. Interestingly, from my
            previous work from the space shooter game, I knew how to get items out of arrays (but I didn't need to use it here), but I wasn't
            particularly good at creating the arrays themselves. So yeah. This project basically taught me that. Yay!</p>
